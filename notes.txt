power MCU from battery
power USB function from USB

So we might need a way to separate LDO from 3.3V and we might want to separate
LDO from USB, if we want self-powered device.

====

We gotta specify what speed we are.
We gotta specify if we're bus-powered or not.


We gotta make sure we're not powering the bus.

We want to support:
    * VDD(A) from a source, VDD_USB from VBUS
    * Both VDD(A) and VDD_USB from a source
    * Both VDD(A) and VDD_USB from VBUS

Since separate VDD_USB requires power sequencing, for simplicity's sake, we're
only going to support in the first iteration:
    * Both VDD(A) and VDD_USB from a source
        * Can draw up to one unit from VBUS
        * MUST NOT drive VBUS
        * MUST NOT pull up a D line until VBUS is present
    * Both VDD(A) and VDD_USB from VBUS

How do we deal with VBUS detection?
    If we're bus-powered:
        * we can still check it before enabling the peripheral
    If we're self-powered
        * we have to check it before enabling the peripheral
Why is it necessary?
    Because we should not pull a D line before VBUS is present

We gotta break VBUS, +5V and +3.3V out to the board pins, provide default
configuration, but allow rearranging those.
